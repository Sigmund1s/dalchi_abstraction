Required software: VS Code and .NET Framework (latest version is 4.8).
Description: This program utilizes classes to run a game called HILO. It is a guessing game where you guess if the next card is higher or lower than the previous card. 

Explanation: I made 5 different classes: Cards, Text, Score, GameOver, and GameRunner. Cards utilizes a random number generator in the range of 1 to 13 and can't return the same number as the previous card. Text is in charge of the outputs and inputs for the game. Score keeps track of the score and changes the score based on if the player guessed right for the given round. GameOver keeps track of if the score gets below 0. GameRunner is the main for the program and is in charge of all the other classes.
